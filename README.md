This game is a my protoyping project with the mixture of top down shooter and tower defence. It includes coin system to purchase monster towns, basic top-down shooter mechanics, drag and drop behavior to place spawners and defending, AI movement, shooting and attacking.

The game is played with two players. One player is the defender that places the spawners on the map, other one is attacker who tries to beat the level monsters designed by first player and tries to reach exit line.
